<p>Public National Structure Inventory (2010) data (from the former https://data.femadata.com/FIMA/NSI_2010 site, no longer up) for Alaska and Hawaii, and Hazus 4.0 dasymmetric population data for Puerto Rico.  Note that the public National Structure Inventory has since been updated (<a href="https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/confluence/nsi/userguides/download-tool">https://www.hec.usace.army.mil/confluence/nsi/userguides/download-tool</a>), but it appears that Puerto Rico still hasn't been included yet (the island lights up on mouse-over like the states with data, but it doesn't have a data link yet [2022/12/23]).</p>
