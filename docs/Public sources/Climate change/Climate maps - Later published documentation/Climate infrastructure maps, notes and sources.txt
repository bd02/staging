These reports document the RAND infrastructure modeling that the April-May 2015 maps (SNRA 2015 technical appendix pp. 219-223 figures 14-17) in the SNRA's climate change chapter came from.  At the time their analysis was still being finalized, which is why the "Preliminary Analysis, Results Subject to Change" caveats are on the June 2015 charts in the SNRA technical appendix.  I eventually took the caveat off from the Resource for Planners versions (figures O1-O4, pp. 485-488): since their inclusion was a historical event that we couldn't go back and change, they couldn't truthfully be called "preliminary".  (The vector-graphic versions in the current pdfs were made later to get the overall filesizes small enough to email to Congressional staff -- the unexpected obstacle that derailed my first whistleblowing attempt in early 2017 -- but they are exact replicas of the original raster figures when printed.) 

Using preliminary results in the finalized SNRA documentation wasn't an information quality issue in this case, because the SNRA's reported findings did not rely on these charts.  The SNRA's findings all come from the National Climate Assessment, as the main text (technical appendix pp. documents in detail.  

We did have to repeatedly push back against other climate change 'findings' that may have been valid in themselves (and which may have been validated since by historical experience), but which were not supported by the SNRA sources or analysis that folks upstairs wanted to attribute them to.  By "we" I don't just mean the project analysts, but FEMA staff and leadership as well.  In the end, when the White House sent back its edits to the Findings document with President Obama's personal thoughts on climate change written into the SNRA's findings -- in Words of Christ red -- FEMA gave up trying to reconcile the SNRA's scientific integrity standards with the political environment that the project was embedded in, and just buried it instead.
